Title: About Me
---

My name is Qudoos. I have been writing software professionally since 2000. I enjoy spending time in the outdoors hiking, biking, camping etc. 

Throughout my career as a software developer, I have been very lucky to have worked with some very smart people who were able to carry me and teach me a thing or two. 
I also had many role models in the industry that I followed for years and was able to learn a lot from them. 

While I may not have much more to add, but on this blog I document some of my thoughts on things I enjoy doing (and also so I don't forget them when I need them again). 

Hope it also provides some value to others.
